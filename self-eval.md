# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It's definitely intimidating and daunting at first bordering on discouraging, but I realized I was able to figure out more than I realized! Essentially I worked through and wrote code for the challenges I did understand, and then came back after a walk or break and tried to tackle the sections I couldn't get initially.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow needs work, I often feel I simply can't allow myself time to take a break because I have so much work to do, but I almost always end up doing better if I step away for a moment and return a few minutes later.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to dedicate myself to my breaks and gym time, this week was very difficult to get any workouts in and can feel my problem solving skills suffering as a result.
